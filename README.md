# Expense_Tracker
Minimalistic Ui for ease of use.

Algorithm or small segments of whole project

1. In Build clock with date and time, which will be used further in storing data.
2. Every month title with year.
3. Clicking on month redirects to a new page.
4. Where data about following schema is stored.  

Where there is no need of primary key we are not fetching out any record. Only select * from table and sum of all expenses .

1. One major issue we will face is selected with message to read from message box. As not every message is of use . And also searching for specific message from bank which for debiting money. 

| Sno | date | Time | day | Amount | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
1. So we have to put a message detector which detects messages of use .
2. Each time as soon as a payments is done and message detector searches messages of use .
3. Then we have to implement info search with uses some method I don't know now and extract relevant information from message and then insert this data to the relation or table of database. 
4. Now we have to display this data in app or frontend for every insertion.
5. Finally the total amount displays.
