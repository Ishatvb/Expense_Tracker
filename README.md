Algorithm or small segments of whole project

1. In Build clock with date and time, which will be used further in storing data.
2. Every month title with year.
3. Clicking on month redirects to a new page where data about following schema is stored. 




One major issue we will face is selected with message to read from message box. As not every message is of use and also searching for specific message from bank  for debiting money. 
Database Schema
| Sno | date | Time | day | Amount | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

1.We have to develop a message detector which detects messages of use.

2. Each time as soon as a payments is done and message detector searches messages of use.

3. Then we have to implement info search with uses some method I don't know now and extract relevant information from message and then insert this data to the relation or table of database. 

4. Now we have to display this data in app for every insertion.

5. Finally the total amount will displays as the sum.
